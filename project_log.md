# Audio Restoration Project Log

## Project Overview
Goal: Build an ML model that can restore noisy vintage 78 RPM recordings by learning musical structure from clean recordings of the same piece performed by different artists.

## Files and Data
- **Clean Reference**: `Music/Kimiko IshizakaGBVAria.mp3` (Bach Goldberg Variations Aria)
- **Original Source**: `Music/AaronDunnGBVAria.mp3` (Same piece, different performer)
- **Noisy Version**: `Music/1920s_78rpm_recording.wav` (Generated from Aaron Dunn version)
- **Restored Version**: `Music/restored_classical_audio.wav` (Classical signal processing attempt)

## Step-by-Step Progress

### Step 1: Environment Setup
- **Files Created**: `requirements.txt`, `main.py`
- **Dependencies**: librosa, torch, torchaudio, numpy, soundfile, scipy
- **Issues**: Architecture compatibility problems with virtual environment
- **Solution**: Used system Python installation

### Step 2: Vintage Audio Effect Generation
- **File**: `NoiseAdder.py`
- **Purpose**: Simulate 1920s 78 RPM recording characteristics
- **Effects Applied**:
  - Background hiss (0.005 level)
  - Vinyl crackles and pops (5 per second)
  - Frequency response limiting (3.5kHz cutoff)
  - High-pass filtering (200Hz) for horn resonance
  - Wow and flutter (pitch instability)
  - Harmonic distortion (tube warmth)
- **Input**: `Music/AaronDunnGBVAria.mp3`
- **Output**: `Music/1920s_78rpm_recording.wav`
- **Result**: ✅ Successfully created realistic vintage audio

### Step 3: Diffusion Model Implementation
- **File**: `audio_diffusion_model.py`
- **Architecture**: 
  - U-Net for noise prediction
  - Forward diffusion process (noise addition)
  - Reverse diffusion process (denoising)
  - Spectrogram-based processing
- **Training Approach**: Learn from clean audio segments
- **Status**: ❌ Could not run due to PyTorch installation issues

### Step 4: Classical Signal Processing Approach
- **File**: `simple_audio_restoration.py`
- **Methods Used**:
  - Spectral subtraction
  - Wiener filtering
  - Median filtering (crackle removal)
  - Frequency domain enhancement
- **Output**: `Music/restored_classical_audio.wav`
- **Result**: ❌ Poor quality restoration

### Step 5: Quality Assessment and Analysis
- **File**: `snr_measurement.py`
- **Metrics Measured**:
  - Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Correlation coefficient
- **Graphics Generated**:
  - `audio_comparison.png` - Waveform comparison
  - `spectrogram_comparison.png` - Frequency domain analysis
  - `training_loss.png` - Training progress visualization

## Results Analysis

### Baseline Performance (78 RPM vs Original)
- **SNR**: -0.41 dB
- **MSE**: 0.011043
- **Correlation**: 0.0003 (extremely low)

### Classical Restoration Results
- **SNR**: -0.39 dB (+0.03 dB improvement)
- **MSE**: 0.010980 (0.6% improvement)
- **Correlation**: 0.0005 (47.4% improvement)
- **Overall**: Minimal improvement, poor audio quality

## Key Insights and Problems Identified

### Why Classical Approach Failed
1. **Different Performances**: The clean and noisy recordings are different performances by different artists
2. **No Temporal Alignment**: Cannot directly compare waveforms
3. **Wrong Assumption**: Treated as additive noise problem rather than style transfer
4. **Artifact Introduction**: Spectral subtraction removed legitimate musical content

### Lessons Learned
1. **Correlation is Critical**: 0.0003 correlation shows recordings are fundamentally different
2. **Need Musical Structure Learning**: Must learn from musical patterns, not direct signal matching
3. **Style Transfer Problem**: This is more about transferring "clean" style than removing noise
4. **Architecture Matters**: Classical signal processing insufficient for this task

## Next Steps: Music Transformer Approach

### Rationale
- **Better for Musical Structure**: Attention mechanism captures long-range musical dependencies
- **Sequence Modeling**: Can learn patterns from single clean recording
- **Style Transfer**: Better suited for learning clean "style" and applying to noisy audio
- **Proven Success**: Transformers excel at learning complex patterns from limited data

### Planned Implementation
1. **Architecture**: Encoder-Decoder Transformer
2. **Input Representation**: Spectrogram patches (Vision Transformer style)
3. **Training Strategy**: 
   - Learn musical structure from clean audio
   - Self-supervised learning on single piece
   - Fine-tune on synthetic clean/noisy pairs
4. **Target**: Significant improvement in correlation and perceptual quality

## Technical Notes
- **Sample Rate**: 16kHz for all processing
- **Spectrogram Settings**: n_fft=2048, hop_length=512
- **Audio Format**: 16-bit WAV for outputs
- **Platform**: macOS with x86_64 architecture considerations
